## Palette Challenge

This is my submission for the coding challenge.  

### Live
Check it out live here: [Visit Demo](https://jpmc3630.github.io/palette-challenge).

### Run Locally
After cloning the repo and entering it's directory run:
```
npm i && npm run start
```

### Features
I went for an interactive approach to the challenge, with a bit of a generative art vibe, and hopefully a bit of fun.  
I had fun making it, and wasted quite a bit of time just adjusting the sliders, because it's kind of satisfying :)
